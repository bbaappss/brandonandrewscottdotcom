This is the repository for my personal website, brandonandrewscott.com
The purpose of this project is to baseline my knowledge and skills in web development and design.

## The steps I've taken to get to this point
I signed up for a free Github account
I bought a domain at https://www.hover.com/ 
I created a new repository that will hold the files for my website
I created an index.html following this guide - https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages
I configured my DNS records following this guide - https://dev.to/nickymarino/pointing-a-github-pages-repo-to-a-hover-domain-105e

## The next steps
Set up reset.css
Choose a nice font from Google fonts and invoke it
