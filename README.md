# brandonandrewscottdotcom
This is the repository for my personal website, brandonandrewscott.com

The purpose of this project is to baseline my knowledge and skills in web development and design.

The end result will be a website that showcases my personality, style, and work.


## Human-digestable steps I've taken to get to this point
1. I signed up for a free Github account
    * I downloaded Github Desktop -- https://desktop.github.com/
2. I bought a domain at https://www.hover.com/ 
3. I created a new repository that will hold the files for my website - https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository
4. I created an index.html following this guide - https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages
5. I configured my DNS records at Hover so my files will show up at my domain name following this guide - https://dev.to/nickymarino/pointing-a-github-pages-repo-to-a-hover-domain-105e
6. I set up a local develoment server so I can see my work in progress before committing and deploying it -https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
7. I set up and invoke normalize.css so that I'm working with an ultra clean style across as many browsers as possible - https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
8. I made sure the website looks the way I intend it to on mobile phone and tablet viewports -- https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/responsive-meta-tag/
9. Did some favicon work in AI. -- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
10. Add skeleton of structure that may turn into sections or different pages of the site

## The next steps
- Choose a nice font from Google fonts and invoke it
- Consider Gatsby to get into react eco system
