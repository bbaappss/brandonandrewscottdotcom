# brandonandrewscottdotcom
This is the repository for my personal website, brandonandrewscott.com

The purpose of this project is to baseline my knowledge and skills in web development and design.

The end result will be a website that showcases my personality, style, and work.


## The steps I've taken to get to this point
1. I signed up for a free Github account
2. I bought a domain at https://www.hover.com/ 
3. I created a new repository that will hold the files for my website
4. I created an index.html following this guide - https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages
5. I configured my DNS records following this guide - https://dev.to/nickymarino/pointing-a-github-pages-repo-to-a-hover-domain-105e
6. Set up a local develoment workflow
7. Set up and invoke normalize.css 


## The next steps
